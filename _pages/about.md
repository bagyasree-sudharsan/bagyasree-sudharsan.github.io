<!-- Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically. -->


I'm currently a Master's student at CU Boulder, part of the [BLAST lab](https://blast-cu.github.io/) led by [Dr. Maria Pacheco](https://blast-cu.github.io/mlpacheco/). My overarching goal is to make language models safe and responsible by improving their social and moral intelligence. I'm particularly interested in helping them reason about implicit human behaviour, and aligning them with pluralistic human values. My work is interdisciplinary, drawing on ideas from linguistics and cognitive science to inform the methods I choose. I'm also interested in exploring how these ideas can be used to make models generalizable across domains. I'm looking for PhD positions!

I love books and stories; I think fiction is our richest source of information about the human condition, and one of the best ways to develop empathy for the world. Plus, they're fun! Sometimes I post reviews about the books I've read on [Goodreads](https://www.goodreads.com/bagyasree). I'm also a bit of a crossword nerd, particularly the [Cryptics](https://coppermind.net/wiki/Cryptic).
