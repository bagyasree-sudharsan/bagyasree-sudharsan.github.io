My overall aim is to conduct research to improve language models' social and moral intelligence, and thus make them better at and safer for complex interactive tasks like teaching and psychological interventions. To this end, I'm particularly interested in:
1. Helping LMs reason about implicit human behaviour and language, and aligning them with pluralistic human values. 
2. Integrating ideas from linguistics and cognitive science, as well as findings from social simulations, with traditional NLP pre- and post-training methods to achieve the above.
3. Exploring how these ideas can be used to make models generalizable across social domains. 


I recently graduated with a Master's in Computer Science from CU Boulder, where I was part of the [BLAST lab](https://blast-cu.github.io/) led by [Dr. Maria Pacheco](https://blast-cu.github.io/mlpacheco/). I got my undergraduate degree from PES University, Bengaluru. I've worked on [several cool AI projects](https://drive.google.com/file/d/10CjYX93rFRA03q04vEauFtl9evuk6GOf/view) since I started studying CS — **I'm looking for related research opportunities!**

<!-- I've also done projects on [mention keywords with links to preprints maybe?] -->

I love books and stories; I think fiction is our richest source of information about the human condition, and one of the best ways to develop empathy for the world. Plus, they're fun ([my current obsession](https://www.brandonsanderson.com/pages/what-is-the-cosmere))!  Sometimes I post reviews about the books I've read on [Goodreads](https://www.goodreads.com/bagyasree). I'm also a bit of a crossword nerd, especially [cryptics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptic_crossword).
